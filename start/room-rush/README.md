# Room Rush

Timed design puzzle where players complete a room layout before the clock expires.

## Gameplay

- Finish the checklist before time runs out; avoid overlaps.

## Controls

- Drag or tap-to-place with grid snapping for clean alignment.

## Scoring

- Daily leaderboard category: "Best Designer (Daily)".

## Content and branding

- Rotate seasonal checklists and style targets to keep play fresh.
