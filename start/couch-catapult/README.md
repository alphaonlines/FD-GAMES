# Couch Catapult

Pull back, aim, and fling soft furniture into a moving delivery truck.

## Gameplay
- 30–45 second round to see how many clean landings you can load.
- Launch pillows, ottomans, or lamps from a catapult zone toward a side-to-side truck.
- Bounce off a ramp for style points, avoid the glass table penalty item.
- Session ends when the timer expires; show the final score and streaks.

## Controls
- Touch and drag from the slingshot area to set power and angle; farther pull equals more force.
- Release to launch the current item; a guide line shows your aim.
- Quick reset to restart the round and clear the board.

## Scoring
- Land cleanly in the truck: **+10**.
- Bank shot (hit ramp then land): **+15**.
- Near miss touching the rim: **+3** to keep momentum.
- Streak bonus: every 3 makes in a row bumps the multiplier for all points.
- Optional challenge: launching the glass table costs points (penalty indicator on the HUD).

## Content and branding
- Round title: **“Load the delivery truck!”**
- Launch items are playful home pieces: pillows, ottomans, lamps; glass table as the avoid item.
- Keep physics approachable—simple arc with light bounces—so it runs smoothly on kiosks.
