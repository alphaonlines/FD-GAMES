# Agent Guidance

- This repository uses React with Vite and TypeScript. Use `npm run dev` for local development and `npm run build` before release testing.
- Keep `index.html` in the repository root; do not relocate or rename it without updating the build configuration.
- Follow existing formatting; use npm scripts and linting before committing when making code changes.
